---

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Judge Subagents (2 total - Isolated Context Pattern)

#### `/speckit.review-spec` ✅
**Location**: [.claude/commands/speckit.review-spec.md](.claude/commands/speckit.review-spec.md)

**Purpose**: Evaluate specification quality using agent-as-a-judge pattern

**Key Features**:
- Five evaluation dimensions with weighted scoring:
  - Clarity & Completeness (25%)
  - Testability & Measurability (20%)
  - Technology Agnosticism (20%)
  - Constitution Alignment (20%)
  - User-Centricity & Value (15%)
- Overall quality score (1-10 scale)
- Production readiness levels (≥7.0 = ready, 5.0-6.9 = refinement, <5.0 = rework)
- Iterative refinement loop (auto-fix, interactive, or manual)
- Evaluation history tracking (JSONL format)
- Judge-human agreement correlation tracking

**Invocation Method**:
```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  prompt: "You are spec-quality-judge from .claude/agents/spec-quality-judge.md..."
```

**Integration Points**:
- Invoke via Task tool after `/speckit.specify` completes
- Fully isolated context (prevents generation bias)
- Can run in parallel with other operations
- Triggers refinement workflow if score < 7.0

     - **Option B**: Interactive refinement (guided)
     - **Option C**: Skip (proceed with warnings)
5. Track improvement deltas across iterations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Scoring System

**1-10 Scale with Production Readiness Mapping**:
```
9.0-10.0: Exceptional (best-in-class)
8.0-8.9:  Excellent (production-ready)
7.0-7.9:  Good (production-ready with minor polish)
6.0-6.9:  Adequate (functional, needs refinement)
5.0-5.9:  Below Standard (significant improvements needed)
4.0-4.9:  Poor (major quality concerns)
3.0-3.9:  Very Poor (fundamental issues)
1.0-2.9:  Unacceptable (critical failures)
```

**Threshold Differences**:
- Specifications: ≥7.0 for production readiness
- Code: ≥8.0 for production readiness (higher bar for security)
- Technical Quality: ≥7.0 for high implementation confidence

### Evaluation History Storage

**Format**: JSON Lines (.jsonl) for append-only time-series data

**Location**: `<FEATURE_DIR>/evaluations/`

**Files Created**:
- `spec-reviews.jsonl` - Specification quality evaluations
- `code-reviews.jsonl` - Terraform code quality evaluations
- `technical-quality.jsonl` - Technical decision quality (analyze dual-pass)
- `judge-human-correlation.jsonl` - Human validation comparisons

**Schema Example**:
```jsonl
{"timestamp":"2025-01-07T10:30:00Z","iteration":1,"overall_score":6.8,"dimension_scores":{"clarity":7.5,"testability":6.0,"tech_agnostic":8.0,"constitution":6.5,"user_centric":6.0},"readiness":"refinement_recommended","critical_issues":2,"high_priority_issues":3,"evaluator":"claude-sonnet-4-5"}
```

**Benefits**:
- Time-series analysis of quality trends
- Iteration-by-iteration improvement tracking
- Judge calibration monitoring
- Correlation analysis with human evaluations

### Judge-Human Agreement Tracking

**Target**: Pearson correlation >0.80

**Methodology**:
1. Agent evaluates artifact → Judge score
2. Human expert evaluates same artifact → Human score
3. Calculate delta and store in `judge-human-correlation.jsonl`
4. After N≥5 evaluations, compute Pearson correlation
5. Monthly calibration review:
   - If correlation <0.70: Adjust rubrics
   - If correlation 0.70-0.79: Minor calibration
   - If correlation ≥0.80: Judge is reliable
   - If correlation >0.90: Check for overfitting

**Calibration Actions**:
- Update scoring rubrics in `judge-evaluation-criteria.md`
- Adjust dimension weights
- Refine severity classification rules
- Version control all changes

## Evidence of Agent-as-a-Judge Pattern

### Research-Backed Implementation

**Key Findings Applied**:
1. **97% cost/time savings** vs human review (2024 research)
2. **Pearson correlation 0.85** with expert judgment (GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B)
3. **Multi-pass evaluation** for iterative quality improvement
4. **Dual-agent pattern** (generator + critic) for refinement

**Pattern Implementation**:
- **Separate evaluator agents**: Judge agents distinct from generator agents
- **Scored feedback**: 1-10 quantitative scores, not just pass/fail
- **Dimension analysis**: Multi-dimensional quality assessment
- **Iterative refinement**: Critique-improve-reevaluate loops
- **Evidence-based**: All findings cite specific file:line references

**Anthropic Best Practices**:
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 (current frontier model)
- Structured prompts with clear rubrics
- Chain-of-thought reasoning embedded in evaluation process
- Calibrated scoring against industry standards

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Manual Human Validation**:
   - Judge-human correlation tracking requires manual data collection
   - **Mitigation**: Integrate with user feedback mechanisms in Phase 6

2. **No Real-Time Security Tool Integration**:
   - `/speckit.review-code` parses outputs but doesn't execute tools automatically
   - **Mitigation**: Add optional auto-execution in Phase 2

3. **Refinement Iteration Cap**:
   - Maximum 3 iterations to prevent infinite loops
   - **Mitigation**: If 3 iterations insufficient, escalate to human review

4. **No Cross-Feature Quality Trending**:
   - Evaluation history per-feature, not aggregated
   - **Mitigation**: Add project-wide quality dashboard in Phase 6

### Future Enhancements (Beyond Phase 6)

1. **Machine Learning Calibration**:
   - Train on judge-human pairs to improve correlation
   - Auto-adjust rubrics based on prediction errors

2. **Natural Language Explanations**:
   - Generate plain-English explanations of scores
   - Help non-technical stakeholders understand ratings

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - "This spec scores better/worse than 80% of similar features"
   - Benchmarking against project history

4. **Predictive Quality**:
   - Predict likely code quality score from spec/plan quality
   - Early warning system for implementation challenges
