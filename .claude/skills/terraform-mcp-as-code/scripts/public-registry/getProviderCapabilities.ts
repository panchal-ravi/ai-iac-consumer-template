/**
 * get_provider_capabilities
 * Get the capabilities of a Terraform provider including the types of resources, data sources, functions, guides, and other features it supports.
This tool analyzes the provider documentation to determine what types of capabilities are available:
- resources: Infrastructure resources that can be created/managed
- data-sources: Read-only data sources for querying existing infrastructure  
- functions: Provider-specific functions for data transformation
- guides: Documentation guides and tutorials for using the provider
- actions: Available provider actions (if any)
- ephemeral resources: Temporary resources for credentials and tokens
- list resources: Resources for listing multiple items of specific types

Returns a summary with counts and examples for each capability type.
