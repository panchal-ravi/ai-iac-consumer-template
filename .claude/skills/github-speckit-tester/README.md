# github-speckit-tester

Test harness for executing Speckit workflows non-interactively using subagents. Use when you need to test the complete Speckit pipeline (Phase 0 → Phase 3) or individual phases, validate artifact generation across all commands, automate testing of specification-to-implementation workflows, or verify cross-phase consistency. This skill orchestrates the execution of all Speckit commands in order without user intervention.
