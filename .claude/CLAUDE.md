# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note**: This project uses AGENTS.md files for detailed guidance. 

## Primary Reference

Please see the root `./AGENTS.md` in this same directory for the main project documentation and guidance.

## Additional Component-Specific Guidance

For detailed module-specific implementation guides, also check for AGENTS.md files in subdirectories throughout the project

These component-specific AGENTS.md files contain targeted guidance for working with those particular areas of the codebase.

## Updating AGENTS.md Files

When you discover new information that would be helpful for future development work, please:

- **Update existing AGENTS.md files** when you learn implementation details, debugging insights, or architectural patterns specific to that component
- **Create new AGENTS.md files** in relevant directories when working with areas that don't yet have documentation
- **Add valuable insights** such as common pitfalls, debugging techniques, dependency relationships, or implementation patterns

This helps build a comprehensive knowledge base for the codebase over time.
